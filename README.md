This is the short introduction for the project 

The dataset consists of 171 selected tiles from the right hemisphere of a mouse brain. Each tile has the dimensions 1000x1000 pixels and contains 6 imaging channels (nuclei channel, anchor channel and 4 coding channels) in which different markers were used. For each tile 4 sequencing rounds were performed.
